1. Quantitative Analysis
Applied advanced econometric and statistical techniques to evaluate policy impact, monitor performance, and generate evidence for decision-making.

Tools: Stata, R, Python, SPSS, Eviews, SAS, Gretl

Methods: Regression (OLS, Logit, Probit), panel data, time series (ARIMA, VAR), impact evaluation (DiD, PSM, IV, RCTs), multivariate analysis, machine learning

2. Spatial Analysis
Used geographic and spatial econometrics to study territorial inequality, public service access, and policy efficiency at subnational levels.

Tools: QGIS, ArcGIS, GeoDa

Methods: Spatial regressions (SAR, SEM, SDM), spatial autocorrelation (Moranâ€™s I), cluster analysis, thematic mapping

3. Macroeconomic Modeling and CGE
Simulated macroeconomic and microeconomic effects of policy scenarios to inform public investment and fiscal planning.

Tools: GAMS, Matlab, Excel (with SAM models), CGE microsimulation

Applications: Social Accounting Matrix analysis, labor and fiscal policy modeling

4. Qualitative Research
Implemented qualitative data collection and analysis to complement quantitative findings and deepen understanding of institutional and social dynamics.

Tools: NVivo, Atlas.ti, Dedoose

Methods: Focus groups, key informant interviews (KIIs), grounded theory, content analysis, case studies

5. Mixed Methods
Combined quantitative and qualitative evidence to support program evaluations, policy learning, and strategic planning in development projects.

Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Google Data Studio

Approaches: Theory of Change, Logical Framework, integrated survey and fieldwork analysis

6. Theoretical and Analytical Modeling
Constructed analytical frameworks and economic models for academic research and policy simulations.

Tools: LaTeX, Overleaf, Zotero, Mendeley

Applications: Model specification, documentation, and collaborative research

7. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
Designed and implemented results-based monitoring systems to track project performance and evaluate development effectiveness.

Tools: RBM, Logical Framework Approach, DevInfo, KoboToolbox, ODK, Power BI

Frameworks: OECD-DAC criteria (Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Impact, Sustainability), custom indicator tracking systems
